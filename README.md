# Elixir Projects

## Overview
This repository will house some basic Elixir code written while exploring the language syntax in the spring of 2019. So far, I can say this language really does live up to the hype. Though there are some challenging differences to the syntax and some elements of the style of software design Elixir is best at, the approachable documentation, rich native libraries, and very enjoyable testing tools have made it a blast to dig into further.

I will add more code as I complete further projects, but please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or notice anything that can be improved. I am always happy to collaborate and learn with anyone!
