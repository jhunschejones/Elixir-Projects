# Elixir Projects

## Overview
This repository will house some basic Elixir code written while exploring the language syntax in the spring of 2019. So far, I can say this language really does live up to the hype. Though there are some challenging differences to the syntax and some elements of the style of software design Elixir is best at, the approachable documentation, rich native libraries, and very enjoyable testing tools have made it a blast to dig into further.

I will add more code as I complete further projects, but please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or notice anything that can be improved. I am always happy to collaborate and learn with anyone!

## Repository Contents

### Language Basics:
* [Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Elixir-Projects/tree/master/fizzbuzz) (x3!)
* [Anonymous functions and the wildcard operator](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Elixir-Projects/blob/master/find_three.exs)
* [Spawning and communicating between processes](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Elixir-Projects/blob/master/ping_pong.exs)
* [Basic recursion](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Elixir-Projects/blob/master/recursion.exs)
* [Basic pattern matching](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Elixir-Projects/blob/master/task_list.exs)

### Projects:
* [Cards project](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Elixir-Projects/tree/master/cards) - An Elixir module that simulates working with a deck of playing cards, including tests and `ex_doc` generated documentation.
* [Identicon](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Elixir-Projects/tree/master/identicon) - An Elixir module that takes a user input string and generates a unique image that matches the exact input string _(different input values result in different images, inputing the exact same value will generate the same image)_.
* [Discuss](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Elixir-Projects/tree/master/discuss) - A Phoenix web application that allows users to create discussion topics and add comments. This project also allowed me to experiment with additional tools like GitHub OAuth, Postgres, and the Materialize front-end framework.
