# OneFour

## Overview
This is a quick project skeleton I spun up using Phoenix v1.4.6 after completing a previous project in v1.2.5. The differences between these versions of the framework are fairly significant, and adding some "contexts" to this project helped me get a better high-level picture of what these changes might mean for future projects.
