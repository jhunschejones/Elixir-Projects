# Cards

## Overview
This project provides a module that allows a user to simulate interacting with a deck of playing cards. It features double comprehensions, pattern matching, File I/O, and several of Elixirâ€™s rich native modules. This was also my first exposure to testing in Elixir and I must say, I am an immediate fan! Not only is high-power testing functionality come included right out of the box, but Elixir also allows me to test example code I place in my documentation (generated using `ex_doc`.)

Making the shift from Object Oriented thinking to designing in a Functional language like Elixir has been a hard mental shift. I have enjoyed the way it has pushed me to think deeper about application design overall, and the way Elixir implements data structures differently than what I am used to from my other language experience thus far. I look forward to all that is still left for me to learn in this exciting new space!
